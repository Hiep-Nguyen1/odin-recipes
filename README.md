# odin-recipes

The goal is to create a recipe website.
Accomplishing this goal demonstrates my ability to work within html's language to create a main index page and use fundamental elements in html design.
These elementes include:
    -headers
    -links
    -lists (unordered and ordered)
    -text elements (em and strong)
    -images
This will also allow me to practice using git commands and writing proper commit messages.
