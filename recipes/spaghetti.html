        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Here is my simple spaghetti with red sauce recipe that can be whipped up under an hour. My partner absolutely loves when I make this classic comfort dish.</p>
        <p>You can create a dish that is vastly superior to the premade jarred sauces you find in the supermarket. All it needs is a little extra time and effort and your family will beg you for more.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb of ground meat (pork or beef)</li>
            <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 Yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks</li>
            <li>1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp of olive oil</li>
            <li>1lb of spaghetti</li>
            <li>2-3 stalks of basil</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Special Equipment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Food Processor</li>
            <li>Heavy Bottom Pot (like a dutch oven)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by preheating the oil in your heavy bottom pot on med-high. Once hot enough, add your meat inside and break up into small bits (it should sizzle slightly). Continue to let cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>While the meat is cooking, cut your onion, carrot and celery into large chunks and blitz in your food processor.</li>
            <li>After seeing some browning occur on the pot, add your blitz vegetables into the pot and begin scraping the pot with a wooden spatula. Continue to cook and stir until the onions become transclucent, roughly 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add your garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, roughly 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Make a well inside your pot and add your tomato paste. Allow the paste to cook in the oil for 30 seconds, stirring occasionally and incorporate it into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add your crushed tomatoes, mix thoroughly and bring it to a simmer. Add your stalks of basil and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar. Let it cook for one hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, begin boiling a pot of salted water. Once boiled, add your spaghetti noodles and cook according to the packaged directions. Reserve half a cup of the pasta liquid.</li>
            <li>After an hour, remove the basil stalks and add your cooked pasta into the sauce. Add a few tbsp of your pasta liquid and agitate the mixture until sauce becomes fully emulsified. The sauce should stick to the pasta noodles. If needed, add more of the pasta liquid to emulsify the sauce.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Plate your spaghetti, top it with freshly grated parmesan and enjoy!</li>
